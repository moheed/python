L3 Clos Architecture:
Clos networks have three stages: the ingress stage, the middle stage, and the egress stage. 
Each stage is made up of a number of crossbar switches (see diagram below), often just called crossbars. 
The network implements an r-way perfect shuffle between stages. Each call entering an ingress crossbar 
switch can be routed through any of the available middle stage crossbar switches, to the relevant egress 
crossbar switch. A middle stage crossbar is available for a particular new call if both the link connecting
the ingress switch to the middle stage switch, and the link connecting the middle stage switch to the egress
switch, are free.

EVPN:
Ethernet over VPN. [VXLAN]
Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is a technology for carrying layer 2 Ethernet traffic as a virtual private network 
using wide area network protocols. 
EVPN technologies include Ethernet over MPLS and Ethernet over VXLAN.[1][2]

VPLS: Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet-based multipoint to multipoint communication 
over IP or MPLS networks. It allows geographically dispersed sites 
to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudowires.

VPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2
tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity.
